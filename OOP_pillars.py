There are 4 pillars of OOPs :-

# 1. Encapsulation => wrapping up of data and it's relative properties and methods into a single unit.

# 2. Abstraction => Hiding unnecessary details from the user and showing only the necessary details.

# 3. Inheritance => Jaha par hum ek class ki properties ko uski subclass ya children classes ke andar transfer karte hai.
# When we transfer the properties of one class to its subclass or child classes, it is called Inheritance.

# 4. Polymorphism => jiske andar same functions ya same operators ko hum form change karke in multiple ways use karte hai.
# When we use the same functions or the same operators in different forms and in multiple ways, it is called Polymorphism.

Access Modifiers :-
Attributes

# 1. Public => accessible in inside the class as well as outside the class by every function everywhere in the code. 

# 2. Protected => accessible in inside the class + subsclass (Inheritance) by every function


# 3. Private => accessible only in inside the class not outside the class by every function.
