# What is Typecasting?

# Typecasting is the process of converting one data type to another.
# Python provides built-in functions for typecasting:
# int(): Converts to integer.
# float(): Converts to float.
# str(): Converts to string.
# bool(): Converts to boolean.


a = 34
b = "50"
d = 2

print(a)
print(type(a))

print(b)
print(type(b))

# Convert b into an integer
c = int(b)
print(c)
print(type(c))

e = str(d)
print(e)
print(type(e))
