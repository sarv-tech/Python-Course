# What are While Loops?

# While loops execute a block of code as long as a condition is True.
# They are useful when the number of iterations is not known in advance.

i = 1
while i<6:
    print (i)
    i = i+1

print("\n")

# Example :-

count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
