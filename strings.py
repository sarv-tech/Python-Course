# Strings are one of the most fundamental data types in Python. A string is a sequence of characters enclosed within either single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or triple quotes (''' or """).

# Creating Strings
# You can create strings in Python using different types of quotes:


# name = "Sarvesh"
name = '''Sarvesh is
a good
boy'''
# name = """Sarvesh is a good boy"""
print(name)

print("\n")

# Example:-

# Single-quoted string
a = 'Hello, Python!'

# Double-quoted string
b = "Hello, World!"

# Triple-quoted string (useful for multi-line strings)
c = '''This is
a multi-line
string.'''

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
